# _MondrianJS_

#### _A JavaScript based Piet Mondrian style painting generator, 4/13/2017_

#### By _**Wolfgang Warneke**_

## Description

_*"Hey, that looks easy I could do that!"*  It's what we all think when we see the early De Stijl works of Piet Mondrian.  But when we do not work with paint and canvas and are merely relegated to our confined digital lives and various Instagram accounts, we must work with the tools which we have at our disposal.  The HTML canvas will serve as a fine substitute.  Can this Piet Mondrian fellow outperform my mediocre yet budding JavaScript skills armed with mere brushes, paints, and presumably straight-edges of some sort?  Only the art historians of the future will have the answer for this._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Click or touch the blank canvas_
* _Congratulations you now have your very own MONDRIAN.  Good job!_
* _To regenerate with a new Mondrian, click once more or as many times as you wish, guided by the deep-seeing inner eye of your new artistic soul._

_Make sure you have JavaScript enabled on your browser!_

## Known Bugs

_There is a slight chance of no colored tile appearing on the canvas._
_There is a somewhat likely chance that the generated Mondrian will not entirely feel like a real Mondrian as far as it's compositional balance is concerned.  Further proportional guidelines may amend this in the future._
